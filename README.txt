Flexible Layout previews allows content editors to see an example of the layout prior to selecting it in a flexible layout section. The preview will show to the left of the ACF popup when hovering a specific layout.

To use previews, the preview images may be placed inside `wp-content/themes/{theme}/layouts/previews`. The naming convention needs to follow
`{flexible_layout_id}_{layout_id}.jpg`. (jpgs must be used).
